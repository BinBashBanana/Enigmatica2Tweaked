	Astral Sorcery (went from AstralSorcery-1.12.2-1.10.18.jar to AstralSorcery-1.12.2-1.10.19.jar):
		AstralSorcery-1.12.2-1.10.19.jar:
			Changes:

			- Make spectral tools not collide with the player

			Fixes:

			- Only create structure matchers for relevant relays

			- Fix perk crashes with dynamism gems

			- Fix visual glitch with translucent blocks

			- Fix recipes being unable to be crafted if the item to be crafted on was manipulated by other means

		BetterQuesting-3.5.300.jar:
			- Fixed TPS spike when sending large packets such as initial database syncing (only partly. Still plenty of room for improvement)

			- Fixed entity render method not clearing various rotation values such as head rotations

			- Added scroll wheel support for horizontal canvas lists

			- Added WIP test theme that will likely replace the old book-like defaults

			- Changed some networking code in preparation for partial sync rewrites

			WARNING:

			Over the next few builds I will be making some MAJOR rewrites to network handling to finally fix the huge performance issues that have been plaguing large servers for years. This will almost certainly break old expansion compatibility and at times cause desync issues as bugs arise.

			The GUI layouts will also likely be scrapped in the process and replaced with something more resembling an MMORPG (I haven't yet finalised what it will look like yet). Because of all the aforementioned changes I've dropped these builds to BETA status and would not recommend them to be used in major packs releases (build 299 should be plenty stable for that purpose) however I still intend to keep on top of any reported bugs as I rewrite things so feel free to test away.

	Better Questing - Standard Expansion (went from StandardExpansion-3.4.158.jar to StandardExpansion-3.4.159.jar):
		StandardExpansion-3.4.159.jar:
			Fixed right clicking with entity interact task

			Added JEI support to several tasks (yes... I'm sorry it took so long)

			NOTE: Using JEI to looking up items obtainable via rewards won't be re-added due to planned network sync changes. Put simply the client side won't have a complete quest database to search through so there's no point in providing an incomplete response.

	Blockcraftery (went from blockcraftery-1.12.2-1.2.0.jar to blockcraftery-1.12.2-1.3.1.jar):
		blockcraftery-1.12.2-1.3.1.jar:
			Fixed blocks not saving their rotations

			WARNING: Currently glowstone only works on slabs and regular blocks.
		blockcraftery-1.12.2-1.3.0.jar:
			There are a lot of bugfixes in this release. Sorry it took so long to get to this, updates should be more stable now.

			This update was supposed to be much bigger with far more content but will be released over the course of a few updates now to get the fixes out earlier.

			New:

			 * Doors - Both the top and bottom half are customisable
			 * Trapdoors
			 * Pressure Plates - These come in 4 varieties - All, items, players and mobs. Weighted pressure plates are not yet included

			3.2.2 (25 Jun 2019)

			 * Change to Puller/Regulator behaviour: when a Puller Module has a Regulator Augment installed, and the module or router has Stack Upgrades, the Puller will only pull exactly as much as the Stack upgrades define. E.g. with 2 Stack Upgrades, the Puller Module will pull no fewer than 4 items at a time; if the inventory has fewer items, nothing will be pulled.

			0.11.3-366 (20 Jun 2019)

			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Hotfix: fix client crash on player login (an initialization error while migrating Pneumatic Armor HUD layout data)
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#0112-365-19-jun-2019)0.11.2-365 (19 Jun 2019)

			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#new)New

			 * Guardians (and Elder Guardians) can now be hacked with the Pneumatic Helmet to disable their ranged attack. In addition, hacking an Elder Guardian will cancel any Mining Fatigue you may have.
			 * Item Frames and Paintings can now be tracked (and hacked!) with the Pneumatic Helmet (entity tracker upgrade).
			 * Fluid tanks can now be tracked with the Pneumatic Helmet (block tracker upgrade).
			 * Villagers can now be hacked to reset the current trade list. There's also a small chance they might drop something they were trading...
			 * The Pneumatic Armor Jet Boots now come with a HUD display showing useful info like player velocity, altitude, heading etc.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#updates)Updates

			 * Rewrite of the Pneumatic Helmet Block Tracker for huge client-side performance improvements: those painful FPS drops are drastically reduced.
			 * You may notice it takes slightly longer to start tracking new blocks as you look around (a second or two); this is due to much friendlier scanning of the surrounding area - scanning happens over multiple ticks.
			 * You can adjust the scan aggressiveness with the blockTrackerMaxTimePerTick client-side setting; this value limits scanning to the given percentage of a client tick (default: 10%). Raise this for faster block scanning at the possible expense of client-side performance.
			 * The animating marker arrows have been replaced with a more gently pulsing block outline for a smoother visual appearance.
			 * The Block Tracker is now side-aware, e.g. looking at the top of a Furnace will show different inventory contents than looking at the side of the Furnace.
			 * API break: IBlockTrackEntry#addInformation() now takes an extra EnumFacing side parameter.
			 * Item Search upgrade is also now much kinder to client-side performance.
			 * The green highlight markers for item searching now pulse gently, making it easier to spot them in some circumstances.
			 * Entity Tracker & Block Tracker: "Press [X] to hack" and "Press [X] to debug" messages now only appear if you're looking directly at the entity in question.
			 * Previous functionality of always showing the text was confusing since pressing the hack/debug keys does nothing if not focused on the target.
			 * API break: IEntityTrackEntry#addInfo() now takes an extra boolean isLookingAtTarget parameter.
			 * The GUI for moving Pneumatic Armor HUD elements has had some tweaks:
			 * There is now a "Snap to Grid" checkbox and associated grid size slider to make it easier to line elements up nicely
			 * To drag an element, you now need to click on the element to start the drag (previously you could click anywhere on the screen)
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes-1)Fixes

			 * Fixed Pneumatic Armor becoming non-functional after a dimension change and requiring a relog to start again.
			 * Fixed Redstone Tube Module channel display (via The One Probe) not working on dedicated server.
			 * Fixed drones often wrongly showing "Routine: Stopped" in Entity Tracker display, even when they're busy.
			 * Pneumatic Armor drone debugging: the debugged widgets now render on top of anything else in the armour GUI.
			 * Fixed occasional spurious "Insert in a charging station to install upgrades" message that occasionally wrongly appeared on some items that aren't insertable in a Charging Station.
			 * Fixed the upgraded Air Grate Module filter GUI ignoring the "!" entity filter blacklist prefix.
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.11.1-361.jar:
			Updates

			 * Pneumatic Armor HUD panels (pressure, entity/block tracker, aircon etc.) now reposition themselves better if you change screen resolution and/or scaling.
			 * Positioning info is now stored as a resolution-independent proportion from 0.0 to 1.0 in config/pneumaticcraft/PneumaticArmorHUDLayout.cfg, migrated from the main config file ("helmet" section, which is now deprecated)
			 * Best efforts are made to migrate the layout, but you might need to reposition the panels (use the "Move X Stat" button for the relevant upgrade in the armor GUI) the first time you start up with this version. If you start the game up at the same resolution you usually play at, you should be fine.
			 * If your panels are aligned to the right-hand side of the screen, you should have them open to the left, and vice versa. This will ensure panels stay properly aligned if/when you change resolution and/or scaling. You can adjust the opening direction in the "Move X Stat" GUI for each panel.
			 * Logistics and Redstone Tube Modules can now communicate across tubes divided by inline modules such as the Regulator Module. Previously, inline modules blocked this communication.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Fixed Plastic Mixer allowing items to be piped into the output slot.
			 * Fixed clicking the tank in the Liquid Compressor GUI causing the machine's redstone mode to be changed.
			 * Fixed problem where the Plastic Mixer "Item Selection" GUI side tab could sometimes be too small (depending on screen resolution), causing buttons to be outside the tab's area, and thus unclickable.
			 * Fixed Chestplate upgrades being missing in charging station upgrade GUI when Tough As Nails not installed.
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.11.0-357.jar:
			New

			 * Added the Redstone Module, a tube module that allows redstone signals to be transmitted along pressure tubes.
			 * Toggle a module between input and output by right-clicking with a wrench.
			 * 16 independent channels are available; right-click with a dye to set a module's channel (the dye will not be used up by default, but see useUpDyesWhenColoring config setting)).
			 * Add an Advanced PCB to the module to gain some extra signal processing, e.g. integrated logic gates, timers, toggle latches, comparators...
			 * Tough As Nails support:
			 * PneumaticCraft heat (and cold!) sources will have an effect on your body temperature. Take care!
			 * Added the Air Conditioning Upgrade for the Pneumatic Chestplate. This will use pressure to try and regulate your body temperature, protecting from Tough As Nails temperature extremes. Up to 4 upgrades can be added (although the max of 4 would only be needed for the most extreme conditions).
			 * See tanHeatDivider and tanRefreshInterval config settings.
			 * Added the Thermal Compressor, a machine which converts temperature differences on opposite sides directly to air pressure.
			 * Heat will attempt to equalize across sides, so effort is needed to maintain a temperature gradient across the compressor.
			 * See thermalCompressorThermalResistance config setting.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#updates)Updates

			 * Plastic Mixer CraftTweaker support has been heavily reworked:
			 * There is now far more extensive CraftTweaker support, allowing melting or solidifying more than just plastic. E.g. you could add a recipe to convert Thermal Foundation Rockwool to/from Blazing Pyrotheum.
			 * Fluid->solid ratio (mB per item) can be defined on a per-recipe basis.
			 * Conversions can be melt-only, solidify-only, or both melt & solidify. E.g. you could add a recipe to melt Lapis into IC2 Coolant, but not allow resolidification.
			 * Since the Plastic Mixer also colourizes items/blocks, this is primarily intended for those which can have one of 16 colours (Wool, Concrete, Terracotta...). However, melting-only recipes (such as Lapis->Coolant) will work. Trying to solidify to items/blocks which aren't colourizable does work, but still uses dye.
			 * See [https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/issues/343](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/issues/343) for CT docs until [https://crafttweaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#Mods/PneumaticCraft_Repressurized/PneumaticCraft_Repressurized/](https://www.curseforge.com/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fcrafttweaker.readthedocs.io%252fen%252flatest%252f%2523Mods%252fPneumaticCraft_Repressurized%252fPneumaticCraft_Repressurized%252f) is updated.
			 * This breaks the CT methods added in 0.10.4 - sorry! But the new system is far more powerful.
			 * General Plastic Mixer changes:
			 * Quality of Life: The item selection GUI side tab now auto-opens if the Plastic Mixer has fluid in the tank
			 * If there's no fluid in the tank which can be solidified, the item selection side tab now hides the buttons (since they don't do anything). The Lock Selection checkbox remains usable, though.
			 * The misleading GUI arrow from input item to output item is gone, replaced by arrows from the input item to the fluid tank, and from the fluid tank to the output item.
			 * The above arrow has been replaced by a small "book" icon, which can be used to show all recipes for the Plastic Mixer in JEI.
			 * The Item Temperature gauge now shows the required temperature to melt an item in its tooltip, if applicable.
			 * When moving Pneumatic Armor stat windows, the move GUI now shows other open stat windows too (with a grey border) to make it easier to line things up, avoid overlaps etc.
			 * Performance: tile entity data syncing now causes far fewer block/chunk updates, which should improve performance in general.
			 * Performance: player jet boots particles are now all handled client-side; only player jet boots state needs to be synced from server to clients when it changes - much less network traffic.
			 * Performance: crop sticks growth particles are now done client-side, reducing server->client traffic.
			 * Crop stick growth tick chance is now configurable: see cropSticksGrowthBoostChance.
			 * Custom air particle density (used in many places: pressure chamber, leaking tubes, jet boots...) now respects the clientside particle density setting.
			 * Dyed Aphorism Tiles now keep their colours when the block is broken.
			 * Added a self-craft recipe which resets the colour of a dyed Aphorism Tile item.
			 * Made drone area sorting more deterministic (see [https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/issues/342](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/issues/342)).
			 * JEI now shows an info tab for all items & blocks which have tooltip information (same info as the item tooltip is shown here - just another way to view it)
			 * Dyeing drones no longer uses the dye by default (but see useUpDyesWhenColoring config setting)
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Restored the Thermopneumatic Processing Plant "Dump Input Tank" button. Was a mistake to remove that.
			 * Added missing Patchouli docs page for the "Pick Up Item" programming widget.
