Updated 7 files:
	Better Questing (went from BetterQuesting-3.5.300.jar to BetterQuesting-3.5.309.jar):
		BetterQuesting-3.5.309.jar:
			Fixed item selection screen crashing when air is given an ore dictionary name

			Fixed potential threading issue with unexpected shutdowns clearing databases before saving them

			Changed file writing process slightly

			Added texture_empty to possible theme texture options to hide GUI elements entirely
		BetterQuesting-3.5.308.jar:
			Fixed quest line reordering deleting everything instead

			Fixed quest line deletions not working

			Fixed quest tooltips not updating timers

			Changed repeat timers to be based on real time (still measured in ticks)

			Changed test theme scrollbars and inner panels

			Added the ability to switch between repeating based on completion time or fixed intervals (e.g. resetting every hour on the hour)
		BetterQuesting-3.5.307.jar:
			Fixed party invites not sending due to missing expiry timestamp

			Fixed invitations not syncing info about the inviting party

			Fixed party database not resetting when changing servers/worlds

			Fixed invitation database not resetting when changing servers/worlds

			Fixed desynced parties holding clients hostage

			Fixed valid invites not appearing if the party hasn't synced yet

			Fixed item selection editor forgetting the ore dictionary setting

			Fixed quest line icons not supporting ore dictionary cycling
		BetterQuesting-3.5.305.jar:
			Rewrote a significant amount of network handling to be less intensive on weak connections

			Fixed incorrect conversion of 1.7.10 item ID numbers

			Fixed crash when sliced textures are sized incorrectly

			Fixed some NBT data being missing from item stacks

			Fixed fluids rendered in GUIs not using their assigned colours

			IMPORTANT NOTES:

			- Shared party progression is currently not active. Functionality will return in a later build in a new form. Existing progress will be honoured however it will revert back to individual input.

			- This build is NOT final and may undergo further changes to refine the new networking and resolve bugs that may have resulted from such extensive rewrites.

	Better Questing - Standard Expansion (went from StandardExpansion-3.4.159.jar to StandardExpansion-3.4.164.jar):
		StandardExpansion-3.4.164.jar:
			Fixed advancement tasks not using partial writes

			Fixed interact tasks breaking when attempting to sync partial data

			Added shared progress support back to crafting tasks

			Notes:

			I have been constantly re-thinking how to do progression sharing, dealing with offline players, ones that don't have the same unlocked quests, dupe exploitation, etc.

			There are a few solutions I have come up with but some may have more damaging side effects than others or not be backwards compatible. I encourage anyone who wants to give their input on these issues to contact me on the Discord and hopefully I can think of a new solution.

			PS: No I'm not going back to the old system where you could drag users to end game rewards. It was way too exploitable and has already been abused by players on servers.
		StandardExpansion-3.4.163.jar:
			Fixed loot chests throwing an error and disappearing

			Fixed location task inversion not including dimension checks
		StandardExpansion-3.4.161.jar:
			Updated to support BQ 3.5.305

			Fixed crash when JEI was not installed

			IMPORTANT NOTES:

			- Shared party progression is currently not active. Functionality will return in a later build in a new form. Existing progress will be honoured however it will revert back to individual input.

			- This build is NOT final and may undergo further changes to refine the new networking and resolve bugs that may have resulted from such extensive rewrites.

			Note:

			A note for this update, due to the pure amount of changes made between this version and the previous version we're just going to put it out there that this one might be a bit buggy! üêõ If you encounter any issues with how the mod used to work to how it works now please be sure to create a new issue on the [Github Repo](https://github.com/Direwolf20-MC/BuildingGadgets/issues)

			Added

			 *  Added a new and fancy Material List GUI for templates. Simply shift right click with a template in your hand to see the list.
			 * With this you can also now copy the material list right into your clipboard!
			 * Some people where finding it hard to open the Copy & Paste Gadgets GUI in tight spaces so to help with this we've added a button in the Radial Menu (G) to go straight to it :)
			Changed

			 *  The Building and Exchanging Gadgets mode System, to make it more open for future additions. Thanks @hnOsmium001 for his PR.
			 * This also resulted in a lot of changes - please report any bugs you might encounter as a lot of the core functionality has been changed in this version.
			 * Updated the Destruction Gadget's GUI as it needed some scaling and usability work. It's better but it's not pretty! Soz.
			 * The destruction gadget now uses a different kind of magic for finding connected blocks. This should resolve any issues people have been having with less powerful computers and large selection ranges.
			 * Added slightly better handling of random crashes to hopefully reduce them... Wish us luck.
			Fixed

			 * Fix typo when pasting a link
			 * Fixed an issue where linked inventories (Yeah, you can link loads of them now. Just shift right click with a supported Gadget!) would stay highlighted in different dimensions.
			 * Fixed an odd one where linked inventories would throw out items if the dimension got deleted.
			 * Fixed an exploit where the Exchanging Gadget could be used as a way to mine large areas quickly.
			 * Fixed an issue with the new modes system using the Building Gadgets range in Build To Me mode which wasn't even close to right.
			For Devs

			 * We're now firing Break & Place block events for each of our tools semi correctly. We've not been able to do large scale tests so if you have any more issues then let us know.
