		AstralSorcery-1.12.2-1.10.15.jar:
			Added more patreon stuff and things :D

			Additions:

			- Added logging to structure matching to allow for more extensive debugging

			Fixes:

			- Added missing AT entry

			- Adjusted handling for sextant target requests

			- Fixed perk cleanup being done after player already got cleared on clientside
		AstralSorcery-1.12.2-1.10.13.jar:
			IMPORTANT NOTICE: This version includes a new command: "/as migrate-data" - This converts some old, imperformant data format to a new format. For larger worlds, please make sure you BACKUP your world before doing that! It might take a long time if your world is larger keep that in mind!

			Additions:

			- Yet again MOAR patreon effects! :P

			- Command: "/as migrate-data" - Check the notice.

			- Logging for perk-related behavior

			Changes:

			- Perks around the "Consistent Luck" and "Spectral Wings" perk are at least a bit useful now as their prior negative effects could be avoided with perk seals anyway
